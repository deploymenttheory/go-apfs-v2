// CopySecurityFrom validates the tree and acquires source metadata before

// readers directly. All callbacks must leave the destination tree untouched.
// Fatal capture errors stop before target ACL reads, volume queries or edits.
// Inspect Capture.Failures: native stat fallback can complete with unobserved
// ACL properties. Copy.Completed means staged; serialization must still succeed.
// This shared implementation supports Linux, macOS and Windows. Native host
// bindings and full restoration ordering are separate from image staging.
