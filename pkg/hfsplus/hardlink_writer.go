// Writing hard links.
//
// HFS+ represents several names for one file indirectly. The content lives in
// an "indirect node" file called iNodeNNNN inside a private directory at the
// volume root, and each visible name is a catalog record carrying the 'hlnk'
// file type, the 'hfs+' creator, and the indirect node's catalog id in the BSD
// info's special field. The indirect node puts the number of names in that same
// field.
//
// The shape here follows a volume macOS created rather than the prose: its
// private directory carries the folder-count flag, invisible and name-locked
// Finder flags, a Finder location of (0x4000, 0x4000) and a mode with no
// permission bits at all, and its indirect node holds the file's extended
// attributes as well as its content.
